# FlightSimulatorApp  
## Overview  
In this project we created a user interface that communicates with a flight simulator and opearates the plane  
with the joystick and the sliders.  
In the joysick:  
**Right and left** controls the Rudder.  
**Up and down** controls the Elevator.  
Sliders:  
**Verticl** controls the Eileron.  
**Horizontal** controls the Thrttle.  
The app receives information from the simulator and displays it.  
In the map there is a mark the represents the plane and it moves according to the given coordinates from the simulator.

### Communication  
The ip and port are shown in the left corner of the app and can be changed by prresing the "setting" button.  
A new window will pop and the user can type new ip and port addresses and click "ok" to save the changes.  
To really connect to the new ip and port click the "connect" button.  

### How to use  
1. place all the file in a new folder called "FlightSimulator".  
2. Place the  "FlightSimulator" folder in a zip folder called "FlightSimulator". 
3. Place the dummy_server and build_and_run files in the same location as the zip folder.  
4. Double click the dummy_server.  
5. Double click the build_and_run.
